## Project Description

This web-based calculator showcases my problem-solving skills, mathematical logic understanding, and UI design abilities.

## Usage

To use this simple math calculator, follow these steps:

1. Input: Enter the numbers and operators you want to perform calculations on. You can use the provided buttons or the keyboard for numeric input.

2. Operators: Use the standard mathematical operators for calculations. For addition, use the "+" symbol. For subtraction, use the "-" symbol. For multiplication, use the "\*" symbol. For division, use the "/" symbol.

3. Order of Operations: The calculator follows the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which means it performs calculations in the following order: parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division (left-to-right), addition, and subtraction (left-to-right).

4. Clearing: To clear the input or start a new calculation, you can use the "Clear" or "AC" button.

5. Result: Once you have entered the desired numbers and operators, press the "Equals" or "Calculate" button to obtain the result of the calculation.

6. Decimal Numbers: You can use decimal numbers by inputting the decimal point (e.g., 3.14).

Error Handling: The calculator may display an error message if you enter an invalid expression or perform an operation that is not mathematically possible, such as dividing by zero.

Remember to double-check your input and calculations to ensure accuracy.

> Note: This calculator is designed for basic mathematical operations. For more complex calculations or advanced functions, consider using specialized calculators or software tools.
